# ROCO507_Group3

This project proposed an artificial intelligence supported framework for automation of disinfecting assignments via a mobile robot.
The IDMR will be able to carry out two disinfecting operations through utilizing two UV (ultraviolet) lights arms as well as air sprayed disinfecting chemical.
The primary aim of this framework is to develop a rational arm to get to every possible target coronavirus infected place in the indoor environment. 
The robot design meets the design calculation of the Torque stability.
The speed of the robot could be easily controlled by the robot program stored in the sensors and the PLC program. 
Even though the robot is not 100% efficient, it can perform the required duty of disinfection within a short period compared to manual application. Therefore, human beings are saved against such exposure to harmful viruses. The efficiency of the robot can be continuously worked on as technology grows.
